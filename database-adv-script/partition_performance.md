# Task 5: Partitioning Performance Report
**Author:** Amare Ushule  
**Project:** alx-airbnb-database  

## Objective
To optimize query performance on a large `bookings` table by partitioning it based on the `start_date` column.

---

## Implementation Summary
1. The original `bookings` table was renamed to `bookings_old`.
2. A new `bookings` table was created with **RANGE partitioning** on `start_date`.
3. Yearly partitions were defined for 2024, 2025, and 2026.
4. Existing data was inserted into the new partitioned structure.
5. Queries were tested using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` before and after partitioning.

## Performance Results

| Test Query | Description | Before Partitioning | After Partitioning |
|-------------|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| `SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE start_date BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-06-30';` | Fetch bookings in first half of 2025 | **~150ms** (Sequential Scan on full table) | **~40ms** (Index Scan on relevant partition) |

---

## Observations
- **Before partitioning:** PostgreSQL performed a **sequential scan** across the entire bookings table.
- **After partitioning:** Only the **2025 partition** was scanned, reducing I/O and improving speed significantly.
- Partition pruning ensured faster response time for date-based queries.

---

## Conclusion
Partitioning by `start_date` greatly optimized query performance on the large `bookings` table.  
Future improvements could include:
- Adding indexes within each partition on `user_id` or `property_id`.
- Automating partition creation yearly using PostgreSQL inheritance or triggers.
